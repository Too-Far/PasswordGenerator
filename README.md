# Password Generator

This is my very first GUI script that can be used on the desktop! It is a very simple password generator. You can input whatever number of charactors you would like in the password and hit go. When it pops up you will have the option to copy the new password at the touch of a button and past wherever you need it. 

## Getting Started

Simply fork and clone this repo to your own, then install locally. When the project is downloaded you can run:
py2applet --make-setup MyApplication.py
followed by 
python setup.py py2app

## Deployment

Once the above is done, you will have a functional app (on MAC)
